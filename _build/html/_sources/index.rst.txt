What is WRF-Hydro?
------------------
.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: justify;">

   <p>WRF-Hydro (Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system) is an advanced, community-based modeling framework developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It integrates atmospheric and hydrological processes to simulate and predict water cycle components such as precipitation, runoff, and streamflow. WRF-Hydro is widely used for flood forecasting, water resource management, and climate impact studies. <p>

      <li><strong>Hydrological forecasting:</strong> Improving predictions of river flows, floods, and droughts.</li>
      <li><strong>Water resource management:</strong> Supporting sustainable water allocation and conservation.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate change adaptation:</strong> Assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources and developing adaptation strategies.</li>

   <div style="text-align: justify;">

      <p> WRF-Hydro Operationalization Task Team is a collaborative initiative between the Ethiopian Meteorological Institution (EMI), Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), and Addis Ababa University (AAU). The team's primary objective is to successfully implement and operationalize the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydro (WRF-Hydro) model within the EMI. By leveraging the expertise and resources of EMI, SMHI, and AAU, the task team aims to establish a robust and reliable WRF-Hydro operational system that benefits Ethiopia's society and environment. </p>
